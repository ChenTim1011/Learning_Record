1.1 Introduction 

Computers are important and we can see it every where in our daily life.



Hardware or software component How this component affects performance

1. Algorithm Determines both the number of source-level statements and the number of I/O operations executed


2. Programming language,compiler, and architecture

Determines the number of computer instructionsfor each source-level statement


3. Processor and memory system

Determines how fast instructions can be executed 

4. I/O system (hardware andoperating system)

Determines how fast I/O operations may be executed


■ In the category of data level parallelism, in Chapter 3 we use subword
parallelism via C intrinsics to increase performance by a factor of 3.8.
■ In the category of instruction level parallelism, in Chapter 4 we use loop
unrolling to exploit multiple instruction issue and out-of-order execution
hardware to increase performance by another factor of 2.3.
■ In the category of memory hierarchy optimization, in Chapter 5 we use
cache blocking to increase performance on large matrices by another factor
of 2.5.
■ In the category of thread level parallelism, in Chapter 6 we use parallel for
loops in OpenMP to exploit multicore hardware to increase performance by
another factor of 14.
