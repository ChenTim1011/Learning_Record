I mainly want to learn about development tools, specifically for a project that uses React on the frontend.<br>
I want to start by understanding the basics.<br>

Knowledge can be categorized into two types: what you know you don't know and unknown unknown. The former can be addressed with AI, but the latter cannot. Therefore, I want to first grasp some foundational knowledge about React, so that I can better use AI to assist in development and make more accurate prompts for changes and improvements.<br>

The content is a mix of tutorials from various websites.<br>

**你必須要在掌握正確核心觀念的前提下，帶著這些東西有意識的去投入實作累積，才會產生內化到思維中的進步成效，兩者缺一不可**

忽略基本功的重要性而憑感覺依樣畫葫蘆，確實是相對簡單輕鬆的。但如果你把這項技術當作專業能力投入在工作上的話，這可能就不是那麼理想的專業態度的展現。
你得先尊重自己是一位擁有專業知識與技術的工程師，<br>
**而不是只個懂皮毛的流水線作業員**

，則你的工作夥伴乃至於這個業界，也才會尊重你的專業能力以及態度。

不能是憑感覺寫這樣很危險，我要學習背後的邏輯是什麼，遇到問題才知道該如何解決，這也是和別人拉開差距的作法

To achieve meaningful progress and internalize knowledge into your thought process, you must consciously engage in practical accumulation while mastering the correct core concepts. Both aspects are indispensable.

Neglecting the importance of foundational skills and merely copying by feel may indeed seem relatively easy and effortless. However, if you consider this technology as a professional skill for your job, such an approach might not reflect an ideal professional attitude. You need to respect yourself as an engineer with professional knowledge and skills, rather than just a surface-level assembly line worker. Only then will your colleagues and the industry respect your professional abilities and attitude.
